Blog CMS Package Initialization
=============================================================================

This file makes the blog_cms directory a Python package.
Python packages can contain modules, sub-packages, and be imported.

Why is this file needed?
    - Without __init__.py, Python won't recognize this as a package
    - Django needs to import blog_cms.settings, blog_cms.urls, etc.
    - This file can be empty, but can also contain initialization code

This file is intentionally minimal.
